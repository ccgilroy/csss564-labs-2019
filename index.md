This page hosts the lab materials for CSSS 564 at the University of Washington. On the individual lab pages, you can see outlines of the material we'll cover and output for some of the code.

To work through the labs, you should download the lab materials from Canvas or from the associated GitHub repository: https://github.com/ccgilroy/csss564-labs-2019

***Note (2021-04-05):** I was the teaching assistant for CSSS 564 in Spring 2018 and Spring 2019, and took the course myself in 2017. Some of these materials for 2019, especially Lab 8 on shrinkage and regularized regression, are adapted and heavily simplified from [Jeff Arnold's course notes](https://jrnold.github.io/bayesian_notes/) from 2017 and 2018.*
